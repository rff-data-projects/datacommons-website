                  <p>Wildfire activity has increased in the western US over the past several decades, with
                      fires becoming larger and more severe. Figure 1 shows total area burned within the
                      western US each year from 1985-2017, based on data from the US Geological Survey
                      Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity project. Compared to the decade 1985-1994, in which
                      XX burned each year on average, XX acres burned on average each year in the decade
                      2004-2015.</p>

                  <h5>Fire severity is increasing too</h5>
                  <p>Fires have also increased in severity over this period. Among wildfire scientists, fire
                      “severity” refers to the extent of impacts a fire has to vegetation and soils; for
                      example,
                      a low-severity fire may cause limited mortality to overstory trees, whereas a
                      high-severity
                      fire kills a high percentage of overstory trees. Parks and Abatzoglou (2020) assembled a
                      data set describing the percentage of total forest area burned each year that burned at
                      high
                      severity, according to a metric described in the paper. As Figure 2 shows, the average
                      annual percentage area burned at high severity has increased over time, though this
                      number
                      is highly variable, especially during early parts of the sample period when fewer total
                      acres were burning each year.</p>

                  <h5>Wildfire Activity in Western States</h5>
                  <p>Figure 3 shows increases in wildfire activity in the western US geographically, based
                      on
                      data
                      from the USGS MTBS project. The left panel shows the percentage of each county that
                      burned
                      on average during the decade 1985-1994, while the left panel shows average annual
                      percentage
                      area burned from 2005-2014. In the early decade, wildfire activity was highest in
                      central
                      Idaho and in the Yellowstone region (due in part to the famous Yellowstone fires of
                      1988).
                      By the late decade, percentage area burned had increased throughout much of the
                      study
                      region, with notable increases in Idaho, the Cascade Range of Oregon and Washington,
                      northern California, and the southern California coast.

                  <h5>In the United States, exposure to harmful levels of wildfire smoke has increased sharply
                      in
                      recent years.</h5>
                  <p>One of the most damaging pollutants from wildfires is PM2.5, a mixture of chemical
                      species
                      characterized by their small size that can lodge deep within our lungs and even enter
                      our
                      bloodstreams. Numerous scientific studies have linked PM2.5 exposure to health problems,
                      including asthma, heart attacks, and premature death in people with heart or lung
                      disease.
                  </p>
                  <p>Researchers from Stanford University used statistical modeling and artificial
                      intelligence to
                      estimate concentrations of PM2.5 attributable to wildfire smoke across the US for the
                      15-year period from 2006 to 2020 (Childs et al, 2022). The plot below shows the maximum
                      daily concentration of PM2.5 attributable to wildfires by state and year. PM2.5
                      concentrations in excess of 35 mg/m3 (dotted horizontal line) are considered harmful to
                      public health and are in violation of the Clean Air Act’s National Ambient Air Quality
                      Standards (NAAQS). In 2020, wildfires alone caused PM2.5 concentrations to rise above
                      this
                      threshold in seven states. </p>

                  <h5>Where are Americans are most at risk of wildfire smoke exposure?</h5>
                  <p>To visualize where Americans are most at risk of wildfire smoke exposure and how this
                      risk is
                      evolving over time, we plot the number of days with wildfire PM2.5 concentrations
                      exceeding
                      the 35 mg/m3 threshold by county for two five-year periods: 2006-2010 (left) and

                      had at
                      least one day exceeding the NAAQS standard. Just 10 years later, 518 counties

                      71 Americans had at least one day exceeding the standard.</p>

                  <h5>Understanding nationwide effects</h5>
                  <p>The plots above illustrate that wildfire smoke poses a significant threat to human health
                      and
                      the environment in the American West. But PM2.5 from wildfires can combine with PM2.5
                      from
                      other sources to create hazardous conditions in other regions, too. Below, we show the
                      correlation between total PM2.5 (from all sources) and PM2.5 attributable to wildfire by
                      census region at the county-by-day level. The top panel shows these relationships in the
                      year 2015, a year hard-hit by wildfires. In that year, wildfires explain almost 50% of
                      the
                      variation (R2 = 0.48) in total PM2.5 concentrations in the Western US.</p>
                  <p>But wildfires also explain significant variation in total PM2.5 concentrations in other
                      regions: 31% in the Midwest, 10% in the South, and 14% in the Northeast. Across the US,
                      wildfire
                      is a contributing factor on nearly half of all days with harmful PM2.5 levels. But
                      wildfire need
                      not drive up PM2.5 concentrations if we can get burning under control. In 2014, a year
                      with far
                      less burned area and smoke attributable to wildfires, the wildfires explained only 12%
                      of the
                      variation in PM2.5 concentrations in the West and less than 5% in all other regions
                      (bottom
                      panel).</p>

                  <h5>Heatwaves are on the rise.</h5>
                  <p>In the United States, exposure to extreme heat is on the rise. The average American went
                      from
                      experiencing three heat waves per year during the 1980s to five heat waves per year
                      during
                      the 2010s. Heatwaves have also become more severe over time. In recent years, the
                      average
                      heatwave has lasted about four days. This is one day longer than the average heatwave in
                      the
                      1980s. During the same period, the average intensity of heatwaves increased by 0.25
                      degrees
                      Celsius.</p>
                  <p>Heat waves are not just uncomfortable, they can lead to lasting impacts on people and the
                      economy. Numerous studies have linked extreme heat with illness and death among
                      vulnerable
                      populations such as older adults, very young children, and those with chronic health
                      conditions (CITE). Extreme heat can lead to other negative impacts too – for example,
                      harming crops, increasing the risk of wildfires, and damaging essential services such as
                      transportation and energy systems (CITE). Following the Environmental Protection Agency
                      (EPA), we define a heat wave as a period of at least two consecutive days with daily
                      minimum
                      temperatures above the 85th percentile of historical July and August temperatures
                      (1981-1990) for that location. </p>

                  <p>The top panel of the figure below [change language] show the number of heat waves between
                      1981 and 1985 (left) and between 2016 and 2020 (right) by US county. Almost all regions
                      of
                      the US have experienced a significant increase in extreme heat exposure over the last
                      several decades, but the trend is most concerning in the Southern US, where some
                      counties
                      are now experiencing more than 10 heatwaves per year, on average. The bottom panel of
                      the
                      figure shows that the average length of heatwaves has increased most in the Southern and
                      Western US and now exceeds five days in much of the county.

                  <h5>The relationship between heatwaves and community resilience</h5>
                  <p>One concerning feature of the geographic distribution of extreme heat is that heat waves
                      tend
                      to disproportionately affect communities that are less prepared to mitigate their
                      negative
                      impacts. Below, we plot the correlation between the number of heatwaves in the most
                      recent
                      five-year period (2016 to 2020) and a measure of community-level resilience available
                      from
                      FEMA’s National Risk Index. FEMA defines community resilience as “the ability of a
                      community
                      to prepare for anticipated natural hazards, adapt to changing conditions, and withstand
                      and
                      recover rapidly from disruptions.” There is a strong negative correlation between the
                      county-level number of heat waves and community resilience score, meaning that
                      communities
                      with lower resilience tend to experience more heat waves. The community resilience score
                      considers six broad categories of resilience: social, economic, community capital,
                      institutional, infrastructural, and environmental. We could also use the large catalog
                      of
                      county-level measures available on Data Commons to further explore which populations are
                      disproportionally exposed to extreme heat. For example, you can view the association
                      between
                      heat wave exposure and median income here. </p>
